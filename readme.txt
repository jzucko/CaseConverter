In this project, you are going to build a program that takes a camelCase 
or PascalCase formatted string as input and converts that to a snake_case 
formatted string using two approaches. First, you'll use a for loop and then 
list comprehension to achieve the same results. 
You'll see how list comprehension can make your code more concise.
